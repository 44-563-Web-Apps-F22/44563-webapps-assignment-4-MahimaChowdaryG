<p class="song">
Within its wall of rock
The flower of the brave
    Have perished with a constancy unshaken.
From the dungeon to the block,
    From the scaffold to the grave,
    Is a journey many gallant hearts have taken.

And the wicked flames may hiss
    Round the heroes who have fought
    For conscience and for home in all its beauty,
But the grim old fortalice
    Takes little heed of aught
That comes not in the measure of its duty. 

The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
And men may bleed and men may burn,
O'er London town and its golden hoard
I keep my silent watch and ward!      
</p>     
<h5 class="chorus">CHORUS</h5>
<p class="song">
The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
O'er London town and all its hoard,
And men may bleed and men may burn,
O'er London town and all its hoard,
O'er London town and its golden hoard
I keep my silent watch and ward!

[Exeunt all but PHOEBE. Enter SERGEANT MERYLL.
</p>
<h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
<p class="speech">
Father! Has no reprieve arrived for the poor
gentleman?
</p>
<h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
<p class="speech">
No, my lass; but there's one hope yet. Thy brother
Leonard, who, as a reward for his valour in saving his
standard and cutting his way through fifty foes who
would have hanged him, has been appointed a Yeoman of
the Guard, will arrive to-day; and as he comes
straight from Windsor, where the Court is, it may be—
it may be— that he will bring the expected reprieve
with him.
</p>
<h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
<p class="speech">
Oh, that he may!
</p>
<h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
<p class="speech">
Amen to that! For the Colonel twice saved my life, and
I'd give the rest of my life to save his! And wilt
thou not be glad to welcome thy brave brother, with
the fame of whose exploits all England is a-ringing?
</p>
<h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
<p class="speech">
Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.
</p>
<h5 class="meryll name">MERYLL</h5>
<p class="speech">
And not otherwise?
</p>
<h5 class="phoebe name">PHOEBE</h5>
<p class="speech">
Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
men.
