        <h4>ACT I <br> Scene.— Tower Green <br> Phoebe discovered spinning.</h4>
        <pre>
  DAME      Within its wall of rock
            The flower of the brave
                 Have perished with a constancy unshaken.
            From the dungeon to the block,
                 From the scaffold to the grave,
                 Is a journey many gallant hearts have taken.

            And the wicked flames may hiss
                 Round the heroes who have fought
                 For conscience and for home in all its beauty,
            But the grim old fortalice
                 Takes little heed of aught
                      That comes not in the measure of its duty.

            The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
            And men may bleed and men may burn,
            O'er London town and its golden hoard
            I keep my silent watch and ward!

  CHORUS    The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
            O'er London town and all its hoard,
            And men may bleed and men may burn,
            O'er London town and all its hoard,
            O'er London town and its golden hoard
            I keep my silent watch and ward!

       [Exeunt all but PHOEBE. Enter SERGEANT MERYLL.

  PHOEBE    Father! Has no reprieve arrived for the poor
            gentleman?

  MERYLL    No, my lass; but there's one hope yet. Thy brother
            Leonard, who, as a reward for his valour in saving his
            standard and cutting his way through fifty foes who
            would have hanged him, has been appointed a Yeoman of
            the Guard, will arrive to-day; and as he comes
            straight from Windsor, where the Court is, it may be—
            it may be— that he will bring the expected reprieve
            with him.

  PHOEBE    Oh, that he may!

  MERYLL    Amen to that! For the Colonel twice saved my life, and
            I'd give the rest of my life to save his! And wilt
            thou not be glad to welcome thy brave brother, with
            the fame of whose exploits all England is a-ringing?

  PHOEBE    Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.

  MERYLL    And not otherwise?

  PHOEBE    Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
            men.
